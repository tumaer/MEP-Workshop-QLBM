    "\n",
    "### Initialization Process\n",
    "1. **Normalized Density Vector**:\n",
    "   The input to the $\\texttt{initialize}$ method must be a normalized vector. This means that the sum of the squared magnitudes of all amplitudes must equal 1:\n",

    "   - $\\texttt{density\\_vector\\_normalized}$ is the normalized state vector.\n",

    "   - The size of the state vector must match $2^n$, where $n$ is the total number of qubits in \\texttt{[qx, qf]}. If necessary, padding with zeros can be applied to meet this requirement.\n",

    "## Streaming using the Quantum Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "For a unitary operator that performs an evolution of the state vector, the quantum circuit implementation is not unique. Different approaches can be used to implement a specific operator. Here, we implement the streaming operator using the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum Fourier Transform\n",
    "The QFT acts on a state vector $\\lvert x \\rangle$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\text{QFT} \\lvert x \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} e^{2\\pi i \\frac{xk}{N}} \\lvert k \\rangle,\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N = 2^n$ is the dimension of the state vector for $n$ qubits. $n$ are the number of qubits in the $|qx\\rangle$ register.\n",
    "Taking a closer look at the exponential function in the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) basis, the transformed state is represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "e^{2\\pi i \\frac{xk}{N}},\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the state label $x$ from the computational basis now appears in the argument of the exponential function. This allows us to modify the state label by applying a phase gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase Gate\n",
    "The phase gate modifies the phase of a quantum state and is represented by the following matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "P(\\theta) = \n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "0 & e^{i\\theta}\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}.\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation, we use the phase gate to adjust the exponential term in the Fourier basis to correspond to a constant $+1$ addition in the state label.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Steps\n",
    "1. **Apply QFT**: Transform the state vector into the Fourier basis using the QFT.\n",
    "2. **Apply Phase Rotations**: Add a constant $+1$ to the state by applying controlled phase rotations in the Fourier basis. The rotation angles for each qubit are given by:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $\n",
    "   \\theta_k = 2^{x+1} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{N},\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   \n",
    "   where $x$ is the qubit index, and $n$ is the total number of qubits in the domain register ($\\texttt{qx}$).\n",
    "   For the computation of the negative streaming, so adding a $-1$ use the negative value of $\\theta_k$.\n",
    "3. **Inverse QFT**: Transform back to the computational basis by applying the inverse QFT.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "In the Fourier basis, adding a constant $+1$ corresponds to applying phase shifts to the amplitudes of the state vector. When transforming back to the computational basis, these phase shifts result in a cyclic shift of the states, effectively adding $+1$ to each index."
